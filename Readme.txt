Bird Classification
1. Introduction
There are so many species of birds and it can get really hard even for experts to tell which family a bird belongs to. Here machine learning can be put to good use.

2. Objective
In this project, we have 200 bird species. Transfer learning is being used to initialize the weights. Resnet, InceptionV3 and Xception pre-trained models are used.

3. Steps to execute this Project.
NOTE: Running the whole project might take an extended period of time. Training time also depends on your system's computation capabilities.

i.  Download the project by unzipping the folder provided. Also download the image dataset seperately and upload it in your drive in the following paths:
	drive_zip_file = "/content/drive/My Drive/bird_classification/bird_CUB_200_2011.zip"

ii. In case you just want to see how the model is working, the model is provided along with the code file. Load the model and go to the "Model 			Evaluation" section of the notebook and run the cells under that section.

iii. Before running the code you might want to comment out the models{Incase of multiple models applied} containing the command model.fit


4. Reports
Report is available in the reports zip file submitted on NESS.

5. Important Consideration
This project runs perfectly fine on a windows machine by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on a different OS, encoding might need to be changed.
